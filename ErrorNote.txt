Review:
if (playPromise !== undefined) {
        playPromise.then(_ => {
          // Automatic playback started!
          audio.play()
        })
        .catch(error => {
          // Auto-play was prevented
        });

Update child component's state from the parent component in react-redux

Review:

state = {
    count: 0
}
reducer = (state = this.state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case actionTypes.INCREASE:
            return { count: ++state.count };

        case actionTypes.DECREASE:
            return { count: --state.count };

        default:
            return state;
    }
